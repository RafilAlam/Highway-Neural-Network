# 🛣️ Highway-Neural-Network  
🚗 **Evolving Intelligence to Navigate the Freeway**  
> A from-scratch simulation demo where a trained static neural network model drives a car along a traffic-filled highway — avoiding vehicles and maximising speed.  
> Trained using **genetic neuroevolution**, this project showcases self-taught AI behavior through iteration and selection. Built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript**, with zero libraries — including all rendering, input handling, and neural/training logic.
